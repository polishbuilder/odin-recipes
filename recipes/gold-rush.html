<h3>Honey Bourbon Cocktail</h3>
<p>A Gold Rush cocktail is a riff on a whiskey sour using honey syrup instead of simple syrup. The honey syrup is commonly made with a 1:1 ratio of honey to water, but I find that a 2:1 ratio helps to better balance out the lemon juice and bourbon. This makes enough syrup for 4 cocktails. Serve over a large ice sphere.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Honey Syrup</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cocktail</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups ice</li>
    <li>2 fluid ounces bourbon</li>
    <li>3/4 fluid ounce honey syrup</li>
    <li>3/4 fluid ounce fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>lemon twist, for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a small saucepan, combine honey and water over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring, until honey is dissolved. Remove from heat and cool completely. To account for evaporation, add a splash of water to bring the total volume of syrup up to 3 fluid ounces, if necessary.</li>
    <li>Add 1 cup of ice to a cocktail shaker. Add bourbon, honey syrup and lemon juice. Cover and shake until chilled, 15 to 20 seconds. Fill a rocks glass with remaining ice cubes or 1 large ice sphere and strain cocktail over the ice. Garnish with lemon twist.</li>
</ol>
